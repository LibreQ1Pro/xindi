"""Takes the buttons out of the page backgrounds and the sheets: every button is a tile, a small picture of its own.

    python3 tools/tile_pictures.py --report     (what would change)
    python3 tools/tile_pictures.py              (does it; refuses to run twice; run from display_firmware/)

The stock project drew the buttons into the full-screen backgrounds, and the buttons showed a part of another
full-screen sheet (a sheet held the same button once per place it is used, once released and once pressed). Now

* a page background is the background only (panels, headers, labels): the faces of the buttons are erased from it;
* a button (or an indicator that cropped a sheet) shows ``pic`` / ``pic2``, a tile that has just its size; widgets that
  only crop were turned into pictures (``picture``);
* the tiles that the screen's own code or the host switch (``codesload`` ..., xindi/pages) are named states:
  ``g.port.face(widget, state)`` of the host sends the two pictures; tools/faces.json lists them (tile_spec.py) and
  gen_faces.py writes xindi/screen/faces.py from it.

A tile is what the old project showed in the rectangle of the widget (tile_core.py), so the pages look as before; the
pixels around rounded corners are transparent. ``tools/tile_check.py`` renders both projects and compares them.
