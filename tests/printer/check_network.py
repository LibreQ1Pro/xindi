"""Checks xindi/network.py against the NetworkManager of the real printer (nothing of it is run on the host).

Copy xindi_py to the printer and run as root there:  sudo python3 check_network.py
It lists the interfaces and the saved Wi-Fi connections, then makes a dummy saved connection ("xindi:test", no
autoconnect), toggles autoconnect, tries to connect it with a new password (it fails: the network does not exist,
this takes about 25 seconds), forgets it, and deletes it again if anything went wrong. Other connections are not touched.
