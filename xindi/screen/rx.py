"""Receiving from the screen: the byte stream of the serial port is cut into frames in a thread of its own.

Every frame the screen sends ends with ``ff ff ff`` (``display_firmware/tools/lint_frames.py`` checks the project for
it). Reading in the main loop - which also draws the pages and runs the handlers, and waits for the port on every
instruction it sends - handled one frame per read and lost the others; here the port is read all the time and the
frames wait in a queue until the main loop takes them.
