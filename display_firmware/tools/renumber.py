"""Removes pages from the screen project and renumbers the rest: the project, the page ids of the host and the page numbers inside the event code.

    python3 tools/renumber.py KEY [KEY ...]            (run from display_firmware/; refuses a key that is not a page)

The id of a page is its position in project.json. Removing a page moves every page after it, so this tool changes together:

* project.json (the page list) and the page files, the pages of ``tools/migration_sources/`` (the source of the generator) and ``tools/migrated.json``;
* xindi/screen/pageids.py: the block of the removed page goes, the number of every other page is its new position;
* the page numbers that the code of a page writes as literals: ``prints 0x65,1`` followed by a page number (the sleep timer, the language pages) and
  ``prints 113,1`` (the value frames of the keyboards) followed by the page of the value;
* mockup/pages.json (the readable names) and tests/e2e/golden is recorded again by hand afterwards.
