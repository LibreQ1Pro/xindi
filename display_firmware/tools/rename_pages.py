"""Gives the pages of the project their readable names and puts them in the order of the flow (``mockup/pages.json``: ``pages`` and ``order``):

    python3 tools/rename_pages.py            (run from display_firmware/; safe to run again)

The id of a page is its position in project.json, so a new order changes the numbers. This tool changes together:

* project.json (the page list: the keys and the paths), the page files (renamed, ``name`` inside them), the names of pages in the event code
  (``page <name>``, ``<name>.<object>``), ``Program.s`` (``${page:...}``);
* the page numbers that the code of a page writes as literals (``prints 0x65,1`` followed by a number, ``prints 113,1`` followed by a number): in the pages and in
  the saved sources of the generator (``tools/migration_sources/``, they keep the stock names);
* xindi/screen/pageids.py: the number of every page;
* tools/migrated.json (the hashes of the page files).
tests/e2e/golden has to be recorded again, and the pages that name another page in the host (``preview.cp_data``) are renamed by hand once.
