"""Checks that every frame the screen sends to the host ends with the terminator ``ff ff ff``.

    python3 tools/lint_frames.py          report (exit code 1 when something is wrong)
    python3 tools/lint_frames.py --fix    add the missing terminators in place

Why: ``prints`` / ``printh`` send the bytes as they are, without the end mark that the screen adds to the replies of
its own commands (``get``, ``sendme``). The host splits the byte stream into frames by the terminator, so a frame that
has none is glued to the next one and both are lost (see xindi/screen_rx.py).

A frame is the run of ``prints`` / ``printh`` lines of an event; the logic between them (``output.val=...``) does not
end it. It is complete when the terminator (three ``prints 0xff,1`` lines, or ``printh ... ff ff ff``) follows, before
the end of the event or the closing brace of the branch.
