"""Checks the page ids that are written as numbers in the code of the pages.

The keyboards send ``prints 113,1`` (0x71, a value) followed by the id of the page the value belongs to; the host
dispatches on it (xindi/screen/events.py). The id is the position of the page in project.json, so it has to change
whenever pages are added or removed before it.
The clicks written with a page number (``prints 0x65,1`` followed by a number instead of ``dp``) are checked too:
the sleep timer of the pages sends the id of the sleep page, the language pages send the id of the language
pages the host listens to.
Run from display_firmware/:  python3 tools/lint_page_ids.py
