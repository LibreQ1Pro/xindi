# E2E tests of the Python port

The port runs in a simulated printer inside docker, and everything it does to the outside world is
recorded and compared with the golden traces of `golden/`. They exist so that a refactoring can be
checked: a trace must not change unless the behaviour was changed on purpose.

## How it works

`build_image.sh` builds the image `xindi-port-test` (Debian with Python, Pillow and aiohttp; native
architecture, one minute). It holds only the test support: a `/bin/sh` wrapper that logs every
`system()` / `popen()` command, no-op stubs for system tools (`systemctl`, `dpkg`, `curl`, ...), and an
`LD_PRELOAD` shim (`timescale.c`) that shortens sleeps of 1.5 s and more to a quarter.

`harness/harness.py` runs inside the container and starts the port with

* a **virtual TJC screen** on a pty linked to `/dev/ttyS1`: it records every instruction (`page n`,
  `obj.attr=value`, `vis ...`, `cp0.write("...")`), injects touch (`0x65`), value (`0x71`) and keyboard
  (`0x70`) events and implements the firmware download (`whmi-wri`) and file transfer (`twfile`) protocols;
* a **fake Moonraker** (aiohttp): websocket JSON-RPC plus the HTTP API, backed by a fixture file tree;
  the scenarios push status updates, gcode responses and notifications through it;
* deterministic **fixtures** (`harness/fixtures.py`): `config.mksini`, gcode files with thumbnails, a USB
  drive, update packages, a screen firmware file.

Each scenario of `harness/scenarios.py` drives the port like a user would. The trace has every page visit
with the distinct values of every widget attribute, every websocket message and HTTP request, every shell
command, the touched files, and whether the port was still alive. Repetitions caused by the refresh loops
are collapsed, so timing does not matter, but order and content do.

## Running

```sh
tests/e2e/build_image.sh           # once
tests/e2e/golden.py check -j 22    # all scenarios at once; compare with golden/ (under a minute)
tests/e2e/golden.py check wifi     # selected scenarios
tests/e2e/golden.py record -j 22   # accept a deliberate change of behaviour
```

`XINDI_SRC=<checkout>` runs the port of another checkout (to record the traces of an older commit).

A full run takes under a minute: the harness waits for the port to go quiet (nothing new on the screen for half a
second) instead of fixed pauses, and the time-outs are a few seconds.

A scenario also fails (`BAD`) when the port addresses an object the current page does not have (`version_txt.txt=...` on a
page without `version_txt`): the real screen answers such an instruction with `0x1a`. A step whose events are meant for
another page than the virtual screen shows is wrapped in `h.other_page_events()`.

## Running the port against the screen emulator

The golden traces use a recording virtual screen. For developing the screen project there is also the HMI emulator of
hmi-builder (`docs/EMULATOR.md`): it runs `display_firmware` itself (`Program.s`, page events, pictures, fonts) and the
browser acts as the touch panel.

```sh
tests/e2e/emulator.py                    # open http://127.0.0.1:8765/ ; --scenario boot_oobe | file_list | boot_interrupted ...
curl -X POST localhost:7125/emu/preset/printing
```

One container (`xindi-port-test`) holds the emulator on `/dev/ttyS1`, the fake Moonraker of the tests and the port, so
nothing of the port runs on the development host. `display_firmware` is mounted and the emulator runs with `--watch`:
edit a page or `Program.s`, save, and the emulator reloads while the port keeps running (the port does not resend a page it
already showed, so touch the screen or use the page selector). hmi-builder is found like `display_firmware/tools/build_hmi.py`
does (`HMI_BUILDER`, or `--builder`).

The printer is played through the fake Moonraker (`harness/devserver.py`), which takes commands on port 7125:

| request | effect |
|---|---|
| `POST /emu/preset/<name>` | `idle`, `heating`, `printing`, `paused`, `complete`, `cancelled`, `runout`, `shutdown` |
| `POST /emu/status` `{"extruder": {"temperature": 150}}` | `notify_status_update` with these objects |
| `POST /emu/script` (gcode text) | runs a script as Klipper would: heater targets change (see below) |
| `POST /emu/gcode` (text) | `notify_gcode_response` |
| `POST /emu/notify` `{"method": "notify_klippy_shutdown", "params": []}` | any notification |
| `GET /emu/state` | status objects and the last requests of the port |

**Gcode and heaters.** The scripts of the port run one after the other like in Klipper. Targets (`M104`/`M109`, `M140`/`M190`,
`M141`/`M191`, `SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE`, `TURN_OFF_HEATERS`) are approached every second (extruder 6 °C/s up and 3 down, bed
1.5 / 0.3, chamber 0.5 / 0.1, ambient 25 °C) and reported like `notify_status_update`. `M109`, `M190`, `M191` and
`TEMPERATURE_WAIT` wait for the temperature, `G1` with `E` takes as long as the extrusion, `M603` / `M604` (unload / load
filament) run the macros of QIDI's configuration with their `M118` messages (`echo: Heat up complete`, `echo: Load finish`),
`M106`/`M107`/`SET_FAN_SPEED` set the three fans and `SET_PIN` the LED and the beeper, and `idle_timeout` is `Printing` while a script runs and `Ready` afterwards. Klipper's reply to the RPC comes at once.
A load takes about 40 s (heating 25 → 250 °C) + 12 s.

**Wi-Fi.** `harness/fakenm/nmcli` stands in for NetworkManager (state in `/tmp/fake_nm.json`). Three networks are in range and the
password of each is its own name: `12345678`, `qwerty123`, `letmein99`. A wrong password fails after two seconds like a real
one; saved networks, autoconnect, forgetting, disconnect and the radio switch work. The wired interface is connected
(192.168.1.50).

Differences from the real printer: the emulator does not draw `col_pic` and does not take over the timing of the display;
the other system tools are stubs; the sleeps are the real ones.
